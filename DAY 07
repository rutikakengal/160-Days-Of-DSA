Stock Buy and Sell – Multiple Transaction Allowed
The cost of stock on each day is given in an array price[]. Each day you may decide to either buy or sell the stock i at price[i], you can even buy and sell the stock on the same day. Find the maximum profit that you can get.

Note: A stock can only be sold if it has been bought previously and multiple stocks cannot be held on any given day.

Examples:

Input: prices[] = [100, 180, 260, 310, 40, 535, 695]
Output: 865
Explanation: Buy the stock on day 0 and sell it on day 3 => 310 – 100 = 210. Buy the stock on day 4 and sell it on day 6 => 695 – 40 = 655. Maximum Profit = 210 + 655 = 865.

Answer :



// User function Template for Java
class Solution {
    public int maximumProfit(int[] prices) {
        // code here
        if(prices.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
                res += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
            }
        }    
        return res;
    }
}
