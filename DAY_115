# 3432. Count Partitions with Even Sum Difference 

✅ Key Insight
Let:
L = sum of left part
R = sum of right part
We need: (L − R) is even

Since
L − R = (L + R) − 2R = total − 2R
This is even iff total is even (since 2R is always even).

class Solution {
public:
    int countPartitions(vector<int>& nums) {
        int s = 0, n = nums.size();
        for (int x : nums) s += x;
        if (s % 2) return 0;
        return n - 1;
    }
};
