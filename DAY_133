# 2054. Two Best Non-Overlapping Events

🔑 Key Idea

1. You can attend at most two events
2. Events must not overlap
3. Sort events by start time
4. Use a priority queue to track events that have already ended
5. Keep track of the maximum value of past non-overlapping events

🧠 Approach

1. Sort events by start time
Use a min-heap (by end time)

Maintain best = max value of completed events so far

For each event:

Remove all events that end before current start

Update best

Try combining current event with best

Push current event into heap
